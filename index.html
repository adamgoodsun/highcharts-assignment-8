    <h1>
        Total Enrollment at Florida Universities
    </h1>
    <h2>By: Adam Goodson</h2>
    <section class="text">
        The University of Florida Ranks among the top three public universities in Florida for student enrollment. Although it does not have the largest student body, the one thing that UF succeeds at is its graduation rate. UF boasts both the highest graduation rate and the lowest transfer out rate of these Florida Public Universties with over 20,000 students. UF can be said to be the best in Florida at student retention and graduation. The charts below showcase the numbers.
